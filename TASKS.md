## 2. Architecture & Code Quality

| # | Priority | Task | Notes |
|---|----------|------|-------|
| A-1 | 🟡 | Physical feature migration – move `accounts`, `categories`, `analytics`, `settings` providers + data layer into their own `lib/features/<name>/` directories | Currently re-exported via barrel; actual code still lives under `Expense/` |
| A-2 | 🟡 | Create `lib/features/sms_parser/` proper barrel `sms_parser.dart` index with full re-exports | Partial – `sms_parser.dart` exists but may need updating |
| A-3 | 🟡 | Add Hive TypeAdapter for `CustomCategoryModel` if missing | Check `hive_bootstrap.dart` |
| A-4 | 🟢 | Replace remaining inline `ThemeData` usages (if any) with `AppTheme.light()` / `AppTheme.dark()` | |
| A-5 | 🟢 | Audit all `BuildContext` usages across screens – replace `MediaQuery.of(context)` with `context.screenWidth` extension helpers | `context_extensions.dart` |
| A-6 | 🟢 | Add `AppButton` coverage to all remaining full-width button patterns in onboarding and editor sheets | `lib/shared/widgets/app_button.dart` already exists |
